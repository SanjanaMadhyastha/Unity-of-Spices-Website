# Unity-of-Spices-Website
Welcome to the Unity of Spices restaurant landing page project! This project is a modern, dark-themed restaurant website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a visually appealing and interactive experience for users, featuring a variety of sections to explore.

The landing page begins with a hero section that introduces the restaurant with a captivating background image and a call-to-action button. As you navigate through the site, you'll find a well-organized menu section that showcases a range of dishes, each presented with images and descriptions to entice potential customers. The Chef's Special section highlights a daily special with a countdown timer, adding a sense of urgency and excitement for visitors.

In addition to these features, the website includes a reservation form that allows users to book a table easily. Upon submission, a confirmation modal appears, ensuring that users receive immediate feedback. There's also a contact form for visitors to send inquiries or feedback directly to the restaurant.

To get started with this project locally, simply clone the repository from GitHub and open the index.html file in your web browser. This will display the landing page as intended. You can customize the appearance of the website by editing the styles.css file, update the content through index.html, or modify the functionality using script.js.

For those interested in contributing, please fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, commit them, and open a pull request. Your contributions are highly appreciated!
